# Large Scale Textual Analysis for Multilingual Semantic Search

My thesis presents five key innovations: First, I developed a hybrid language detection system combining Unicode analysis with KMeans clustering and frequency refinement - something not documented in multilingual Indian NLP. Second, I created a novel mathematical framework for bulk campaign detection in multilingual grievances using a specific L2 distance formula. Third, I built the first end-to-end pipeline processing 9 Indian languages simultaneously from detection to semantic clustering. Fourth, I conducted original tokenizer optimization research using entropy analysis for Hindi-Latin code-switching, discovering optimal tokenizers for government text. Finally, I developed dynamic HNSW parameter scaling specifically for multilingual Indian language processing - an original contribution to semantic search optimization..
