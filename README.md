# Large Scale Textual Analysis for Multilingual Semantic Search

This thesis introduces a comprehensive approach for language detection, linguistic analysis, and grievance clustering in large datasets. The first part focuses on language detection, employing Unicode character ranges and clustering techniques to accurately identify languages such as Hindi, English, Punjabi, Gujarati, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Odia, and Bengali. In the next section, dynamic programming is utilized to determine the most probable segmentation of input text, while an HNSW index facilitates the creation of a nearest neighbor dictionary. Spelling correction and word mapping techniques are explored in subsequent sections.

Additionally, a method for clustering similar grievances using text embeddings and the HNSW index is proposed to address the issue of bulk campaigns in large datasets. Finally, the thesis presents a system for language detection, text cleaning, translation, and similarity search, enhancing multilingual data analysis and aiding language processing and information retrieval. Overall, these contributions provide valuable tools for various applications in linguistic analysis and data processing.
